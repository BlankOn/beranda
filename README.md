## How to submit a new post?

1. Create a new markdown file in `_posts` directory. File name should follow `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md` format. For example, `2020-02-27-my-first-post.md`. You can start by clicking [this link](https://github.com/openSUSE/news-o-o/new/master/?filename=_posts/2020-02-27-my-first-post.md).

2.  Please use an illustration image with at least 1153x505px size. It should be placed as well in its own directory named with the date format `yyyy-mm-dd` in `/assets/images`. For example: `/assets/images/2020-02-27/my-first-post-image.png`. If you need help with creating some approriate image feel free to ask in #artwork on IRC, Matrix or Discord.

3. Write content. You can start with the following template:
    ```

    Write you post in Markdown and HTML...

    ```
    The date and time you set here, in the header, will be the date and time your article, once merged, will be published and available on [news.opensuse.org](https://news.opensuse.org). If you set the current day's date, be aware that there might be up to 2 hours delay between the time the PR got accepted and the time it actually gets picked up by the server.

4. Save the file and create a pull request. You can find the button at page bottom.

## How to use emojis in your blog post?

We are using the [Jemoji plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji), which allows you to use GitHub like syntax for emojis in your blog posts.
For example, `it's raining :cat:s and :dog:s!`, will be rendered as:

> it's raining :cat:s and :dog:s!

## How to update the theme?

If there's a newer revison of the [openSUSE jekyll-theme](https://github.com/openSUSE/jekyll-theme) you need to put the commit id into [Gemfile.lock](https://github.com/openSUSE/news-o-o/blob/master/Gemfile.lock#L3) and count up the [version number](https://github.com/openSUSE/news-o-o/blob/master/Gemfile.lock#L5).
